# Chapter 6 Exercises (Making a Difference)

As computer costs decline, it becomes feasible for every student, regardless of economic circumstance,
to have a computer and use it in school. This creates exciting possibilities for improving the
educational experience of all students worldwide as suggested by the next five exercises. [Note:
Check out initiatives such as the One Laptop Per Child Project (www.laptop.org). Also, research
“green” laptops—and note the key “going green” characteristics of these devices? Look into the
Electronic Product Environmental Assessment Tool (www.epeat.net) which can help you assess the
“greenness” of desktops, notebooks and monitors to help you decide which products to purchase.]

## 6.56 (Computer-Assisted Instruction) 
The use of computers in education is referred to as computer-assisted 
instruction (CAI). Write a program that will help an elementary school student learn
multiplication. Use the rand function to produce two positive one-digit integers. The program
should then prompt the user with a question, such as
        How much is 6 times 7?
The student then inputs the answer. Next, the program checks the student’s answer. If it’s correct,
display the message "Very good!" and ask another multiplication question. If the answer is wrong,
display the message "No. Please try again." and let the student try the same question repeatedly
until the student finally gets it right. A separate function should be used to generate each new question. 
This function should be called once when the application begins execution and each time the
user answers the question correctly.
